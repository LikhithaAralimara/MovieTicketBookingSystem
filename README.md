# MovieTicketBookingSystem


Movie Ticket Booking Management System - a complete application where a user can book tickets to watch a movie and review them; and theatre managers can schedule their movies.

-->We have two roles - User and Manager.

-->If the user is a new user, then he/she must first register and then be able to log in to book tickets. The logged-in user can view the movies available and book tickets for movies that have been added to the schedule by the manager. After successfully booking and paying for the tickets, the user can review/rate the movies he/she has watched as well.

-->	A manager can view the current movie schedule for the theatre. He can add new movies to be scheduled or remove existing movies from the schedule.

-->	Both the manager and user views are in sync when a movie gets updated.
